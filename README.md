# ImageCoord field

This is a variant of SilverStripe FocusPoint field, allowing you to use a similar interface for setting x and y coords on a DataObject by clicking on an image.

Not documented currently because I wasn't sure if it would be used outside of one or two projects üòÑ. If you're wanting to use it and need some help, please raise an issue.
